# PhantomKey

PhantomKey is a tool that I have created using the Python programming language. This tool is designed for various security functions, including hashing password, cracking passwords, and identifying the type of hashing used in.


There are 7 types of Hash Functions available in this tool, namely as follows:

[1] MD2

[2] MD4

[3] MD5

[4] SHA-1

[5] SHA-256

[6] SHA-512

[7] Bcrypt


## Requirements
- Linux distribution
- Python 3 or greater

## Installation
```bash
# Step 1
git clone https://github.com/xRiot45/PhantomKey.git

# Step 2
cd PhantomKey

# Step 3
sudo su

# Step 4
python3 -m venv .venv

# Step 5
source .venv/bin/activate

# Step 6
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Type ```python3 PhantomKey.py``` to run this tool

## Conclusion
Here are some suggestions that should be used to secure a password:

- Password Length: Always make sure the password is at least 12 characters long. The longer it is, the harder it is to guess or hack.
- Don't Use Personal Information: Avoid using personal information such as your name, date of birth, pet names, or easy-to-guess words as part of your password.
- Don't Use Common Words: Avoid common words or easy-to-guess phrases like "password", "123456", or "qwerty". Use unexpected combinations.
- Update Regularly: Regularly change your passwords, especially for critical accounts like email or online banking.
